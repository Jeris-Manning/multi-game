## What I did, why I did it, and what I learned

This project started on a whim and an HOA flyer. 
Poker was on TV and I thought it would be fun to figure out the code to determine hand ranks from any 5 card poker hand.
One thing led to another and I ended up fully fleshing it out. 
I later finished a video keno game to go with it as an exercise to have each game maintain its own state as well as having a global state overseeing the player's credits, bet sizes, etc.
